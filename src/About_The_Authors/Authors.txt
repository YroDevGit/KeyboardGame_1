Bugs encountered:
(fixed)- CAPS LOCK : if CAPS LOCK is turned on, can't type a word. - now: can accept any letter(uppercase/lowercase).
(fixed)- TIMER ERROR : when the timer reach zero and you luckily typed the last word to pass the level at the same time,
         both Game Over and Level passed Dialog/Frame shows at the same time. you actually passed the level but the game is over.
         now: TextBox/TextField is disabled when timer reach zero & Timer is Stopped when you passed the level.

(improved) - KEYBOARD KEYS - we decided to Change letters from lowercase to uppercase letters in every words.
                             as the keyboard keys displays all uppercase and capital letters,
                             so it is easy for all the beginner users to find and specify letters from the word.
                             similarities of lowercase letter L that is 'l' and uppercase letter i that is 'I' in some fonts.
                            
(Updated) - EXPERT level added -  we decided to add EXPERT level to the game, the longer you play the game, the more you enjoy playing.
(Updated) - VETERAN and ELITE level added.
